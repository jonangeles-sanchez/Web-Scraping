# Python Web Scraper Script
## Scraper for real estate property.

### What I've learned:
* How to inspect elements thoroughly to meticulously collect data from unique elements.
* How to use a simple function and import the library from Pandas
* How to import data from our output to a spreadsheet file
* How dictionaries work
* One of python's abilities with web work

This code is simply a script that will run using python3. Results may vary as websites are constantly updating elements and structure.
Edit as needed, script should be error-free.

You can also run some basic unit tests by using it on various websites instead of 1.
